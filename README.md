Detection and identification of plasmodiums on microscopic images.

The diagnosis of imported malaria (4 to 5000 cases per year in France) requires the 24/7 mobilization of experienced biologists who must make a diagnosis on the microscopic examination of a blood smear in search of the parasite called Plasmodium. The main difficulties encountered so far in automating the reading of blood smears are the time needed to acquire and process the microscopic images, the consideration of artifacts likely to induce diagnostic errors and the diversity of morphological aspects related to the species and stages of parasites likely to be found on a blood smear. 

The objective set here is to explore several approaches combining machine learning and image processing for the modeling of a rapid and reliable system, allowing an automatic diagnosis of malaria on microscopic images of smears or thick blood drops.
